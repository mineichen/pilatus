# Usage

You can run this demo with or without a UI. Just execute `cargo run` and you should be ready to go.

## Curl
To interact with the app via CLI, take a look at [requests.http](requests.http)

## Web UI
A generic UI, which is hosted on [github.com](https://github.com/mineichen/pilatus-leptos) can be used to play with the example. It strives to cover every functionality of all open source pilatus extensions available. In contrast to the backend beign MPL2, it uses the MIT license which allows you to copy and adapt it for your proprietary project.
