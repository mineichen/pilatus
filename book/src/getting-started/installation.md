# Installation

## Prerequisites

Pilatus has almost no system dependencies on purpose, so it stays lightweight and easy to use. You only need:

- Rust toolchain (stable version recommended)
- Cargo (comes with Rust)
- Openssl installation

Extensions with system dependencies for e.g. Opencv or aravis camera are kept in a separate repository.
